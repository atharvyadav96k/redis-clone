## ðŸ”´ Redis Clone

A simplified in-memory key-value store inspired by [Redis](https://redis.io/), built from scratch as a learning project.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a basic Redis clone that supports core Redis-like features such as:

- Setting and getting key-value pairs
- Expiry (TTL) support
- In-memory storage
- Command-line interface (CLI)

Itâ€™s built to understand how Redis works internally and how to manage efficient in-memory data structures.
